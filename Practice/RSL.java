/*
    A-1: Write a function that takes an input parameter as a String.
         The function should replace the alternate words in it with “xyz” and print it.
         Words are separated by dots.
         (Avoid using inbuilt functions)

    A-2: Given a binary string (string containing only 0’s and 1’s) “str” that contains at least a single occurrence of a numeric value: '1'.
        You have to rearrange the characters in the string in such a way that the resulting binary string is the maximum odd binary number that can be created from this combination.
        Note that the resulting string can have leading zeros.
        Examples:
        1. Input: str = "010"
        Output: "001"
        2. Input: str = "01010"
        Output: "10001"


    A-3: Write a program to find the equilibrium element from an integer array.
        An equilibrium element is defined as the number for which the sum of left side
        elements is equal to sum of right side elements.
        Note: If no possible combination exists return 0.


    A-4: Given an encoded string, return its decoded string.
        The encoding rule is ‘k[encoded_string]’, where the ‘encoded_string’ inside the
        square brackets is being repeated exactly ‘k’ times.

        You may assume that ‘encoded_string’ will only consist of lower case
        alphabets and ‘k’ will always be greater than 0.
        Note: The ‘encoded_string’ can be nested as well. Refer example 2 for clarification.
        Examples:
        1. Input: s = "3[a]2[bc]"
        Output: "aaabcbc"

        2. Input: s = "3[a2[c]]"
        Output: "accaccacc


    A-5: Given a string ‘s’ consisting only of characters 'a', 'b', and 'c'. You are asked to apply the following algorithm on the string any number of times:
        1. Pick a non-empty prefix from the string ‘s’ where all the characters in the prefix are the same.
        2. Pick a non-empty suffix from the string ‘s’ where all the characters in this suffix are the same.
        3. The prefix and the suffix should not intersect at any index.
        4. The characters from the prefix and suffix must be the same.
        5. Delete both the prefix and the suffix.
        6. Return the minimum length of ‘s’ after performing the above operation any number of times (possibly zero times).

        Examples:

        1. Input: s = "ca"
        Output: 2
        Explanation: You can't remove any characters, so the string stays as is.

        2. Input: s = "aabccabba"
        Output: 3
        Explanation: An optimal sequence of operations is:
        - Take prefix = "aa" and suffix = "a" and remove them, s = "bccabb".
        - Take prefix = "b" and suffix = "bb" and remove them, s = "cca".
